je_hpx_italy_reason: "In the aftermath of World War II, Italy found itself fractured, its fate divided among the victors.\n\n What was once a unified nation is now splintered into three distinct entities:\n\n #yellow The Kingdom of [SCOPE.sCountry('savoy_nation_scope').GetName],\n The Republic of [SCOPE.sCountry('italy_nation_scope').GetName],\n The People's Republic of [SCOPE.sCountry('north_italy_nation_scope').GetName],#!\n each laying claim to the mantle of the true Italy.\n\nAs the scars of occupation and division deepen, the struggle for legitimacy intensifies, with Rome—the heart of Italian heritage—remaining under Republican control. But the question remains: who will reunite the Italian people under one banner? The eyes of the world are upon you, as you must prove that your Italy is the rightful heir to the nation's legacy, a unified state, and the one true Italy."

hpx_ITA_event.1.t: "Rome Falls Under [SCOPE.sCountry('italian_event').GetName]"
hpx_ITA_event.1.d: "Rome, the historic heart of Italy, has fallen under the control of [SCOPE.sCountry('italian_event').GetName]. The occupation of the Eternal City marks a significant shift in power dynamics on the peninsula, as control over Rome symbolizes a claim to legitimacy and the right to lead the Italian people. The world watches as the occupiers attempt to solidify their control and assert their vision for Italy's future."
hpx_ITA_event.1.f: "\"The ancient streets of Rome now echo with the footsteps of a new regime. As the flags are changed and new orders are issued, the occupiers of the Eternal City aim to assert their authority over Italy's most symbolic and strategic location. For the people of Rome, the question remains—what does this change of power mean for their future and for the future of Italy?\""
hpx_ITA_event.1.a: "This will be the start of a new Italy"

je_hpx_germany: "German Question"
germany_is_divided: "Germany is divided"
je_hpx_germany_reason: "After World War II, Germany was divided into two separate states: West Germany, aligned with Western democracies, and East Germany, under Soviet influence. Tensions ran high as the Cold War deepened, with the Berlin Wall symbolizing this division. By 1970, East Germany was not only under strict communist control but also undergoing a process of Slavification, altering its cultural identity. Meanwhile, Bavaria had declared independence, further fragmenting the once-unified nation, leaving a patchwork of differing ideologies and alliances across the German lands."
