ig_fascist_desc:0 "An extreme-right ideology, fascism is difficult to define in specific terms. Generally characterized by national chauvinism, a reverence of the state, and a rabid hostility to any Left-wing or perceived foreign elements, it is just as much inundated with contradictions -- while fascists often espouse deeply traditional values, they also glorify the efficiency of modern industry and war. This strange coupling of traditionalism with modernity is part of what sets e.g. clerical fascism apart from traditional moralism, and Italian Futurism apart from socialism."
