# Hyperproxy
An Alternative History mod for the game Victoria 3.

# Installation
We prefer you use the version on the Steam Workshop. If however you need to install from Github: For Windows:

1. Download the Zip file
2. Unzip
3. Look for the `hyperproxy-mod` folder inside. It shoud be in the same folder as the README.md
4. Place the `hyperproxy-mod` folder in your `Documents/Paradox Interactive/Victoria 3/mod` folder. If there is no mod folder, you can make one.
5. Select the mod in the launcher. Make sure you haven't selected the Steam version.
