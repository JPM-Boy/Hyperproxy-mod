germany_is_divided: "Germany is divided"
je_hpx_germany_reason: "After World War II, Germany was divided into two separate states: West Germany, aligned with Western democracies, and East Germany, under Soviet influence. Tensions ran high as the Cold War deepened, with the Berlin Wall symbolizing this division. By 1970, East Germany was not only under strict communist control but also undergoing a process of Slavification, altering its cultural identity. Meanwhile, Bavaria had declared independence, further fragmenting the once-unified nation, leaving a patchwork of differing ideologies and alliances across the German lands."
