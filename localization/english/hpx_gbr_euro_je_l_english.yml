This foundation paved the way for the European Economic Community, promoting closer economic ties. Over the years, these communities evolved and expanded, eventually forming the European Union (EU) through a significant treaty. The EU has grown, with an evolving number of member countries working together on a wide range of issues like trade, the environment, and security."
