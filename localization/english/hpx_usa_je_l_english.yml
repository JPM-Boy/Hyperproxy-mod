je_hpx_usa_the_great_shift_reason: "The #O Great Shift#! (1972-2000) was a transformative era in the United States, where #O civil rights#!, #O worker protections#!, and #O social democracy#! flourished.

Simultaneously, #O Sonia Johnson#! propelled the #O feminist movement#! to new heights, leading to the ratification of the #O Equal Rights Amendment (ERA)#!. The nation also adopted a #O non-interventionist foreign policy#!, focusing on peace and diplomacy.\n\nBy 2000, the #O Great Shift#! had left a lasting legacy, cementing progressive ideals at the core of a newly diversified political landscape and a more equitable society.\n\nList of #blue Progressive Laws#!:\n- [GetLawType('law_federated').GetName]\n- [GetLawType('law_worker_protections').GetName]\n- [GetLawType('law_womens_suffrage').GetName]\n- [GetLawType('law_public_schools').GetName]\n- [GetLawType('law_republic').GetName]\n- [GetLawType('law_multicultural').GetName]\n- [GetLawType('law_public_health_insurance').GetName]\n- [GetLawType('law_all_labor_unions_allowed').GetName]"

As the primaries unfold, the direction of the right is far from settled."
 hpx_usa_elections.1.f: "“This isn’t just another election—it’s a struggle for the soul of our party. Will we double down on tradition, or chart a new course for a changing America?”"

 hpx_usa_elections.8.t: "Form a Government"
 hpx_usa_elections.8.d: "With the election results in, no single party holds a majority. As the leading force, you now face a critical decision: rule alone as a minority, or form a coalition government. The Democrats, Progressives, and Republicans all have diverging visions for the nation—and their cooperation comes at a cost."

 hpx_usa_elections.10.t: "Choosing a Direction"
 hpx_usa_elections.10.d: "The alliance between Democrats and Progressives is rooted in shared opposition—but not always shared priorities. As talks progress, it becomes clear: one party must lead, the other follow. The balance struck here could define the coalition’s success—or its collapse."
 hpx_usa_elections.10.f: "“Do we lead the change, or do we temper it? Every revolution has its moment of decision.”"
