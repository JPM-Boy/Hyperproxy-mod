The loss has shaken the confidence of our people and the cohesion of our republics, symbolized by 'Soviet Unity,' is under severe strain. Maintaining a high level of unity is now more crucial than ever to preserve the integrity of the Soviet state. Should this unity falter, it could lead to the unthinkable—dissolution.\n\nAs General Secretary, it is your duty to ensure that the bonds between the Soviet republics remain strong. You may also consider confederalizing, granting greater autonomy to some republics in an effort to stabilize the union. The future of the Soviet Union is in your hands; will you preserve its strength, or allow it to fragment in the wake of this monumental loss?"
